# JavaScript Library
As part of the [JavaScript Accelerated Learning Program](https://www.elevenfifty.org/courses/#javascript) at [Eleven Fifty Academy](https://www.elevenfifty.org/), I was required to construct a resource library for vanilla JavaScript.
Students were given an electronic copy of `JavaScript: The Good Parts` by Douglas Crockford for reference.
## Daily Requirement
Students were instructed to make a commit each school day.
In addition to satisfying this requirement, I also made commits on weekends.
The majority of this content is from Mr. Crockford's book, reformatted and commented to my liking.
