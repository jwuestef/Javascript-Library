Object literals are a convenient notation for specifying new objects. 
The names of the properties can be specified as names or as strings. 
The names are treated as literal names, not as variable names, 
so the names of the properties of the object must be known at compile time. 
The values of the properties are expressions.

Array literals are a convenient notation for specifying new arrays.
