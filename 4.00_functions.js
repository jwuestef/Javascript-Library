The best thing about JavaScript is its implementation of functions. 
It got almost everything right. 
But, as you should expect with JavaScript, it didnâ€™t get everything right.


A function encloses a set of statements. 
Functions are the fundamental modular unit of JavaScript. 


They are used for code reuse, information hiding, and composition.
Functions are used to specify the behavior of objects. 


Generally, the craft of programming is the factoring of a set of requirements into a set of functions and data structures.
